# AEIOU
First keyboard layout 100% made for spanish language, made by the professional spanish typist **Nick Gutiérrez**. It also works with catalan, basque... and all kind of spanish dialects. If you encounter any bug or mistake, be sure to leave feedback and I will surely check it out.

**Why did I made a fully optimized spanish layout?** 

*I just discovered there wasn't a single specialized layout in my language, and since I work all day long typing in spanish, it seemed logical to look for a solution myself on my free time. Since I'm only a writer and a psychologist obsessed with productivity, I've asked help and tips to experts and keyboard layout specialists and analysts, who made some of the best layouts in the world for the english language: Colemak, Engram... and finally, I'm here with a solution.*

The AEIOU name is based in the fact that all vowels are only on one side of the keyboard. It also resembles the easyness of typing with this keyboard layout once you practice for a few days. 

There's two versions (both of them are better than qwerty, but I personally prefer the first one):

## AEIOU v1.1
[AEIOU Mac install.zip](https://github.com/NickG13/AEIOU/files/6834945/AEIOU.Mac.install.zip)



The main version. You can make Ctrl+C only with right Ctrl, which can be a problem, but you will be more comfortable while typing.

## AEIOU zxcv v1.0

A version for people who wants to maintain all the usual shortcuts (ZXCV). Be advised you will write slower and with less comfort.

## Install
(Windows version in progress...)

[AEIOU for Mac.zip](https://github.com/NickG13/AEIOU/files/6834910/AEIOU.for.Mac.zip)


To install it on Mac, you only need to download the .zip file, unzip it and execute the .bundle and then restart your Mac. Then, you should be able to change the keyboard layout by going to Preferencias del sistema>Teclado>Fuentes de entrada, clicking "+" and selecting your layout under spanish language.

This layout has been made following all the requirements of a good layout, following both Engram and Colemak keyboard layout building instructions, and using several keyboard analyzers (not only one) as well as the tips and review of expert builders.

Here is a [description with all the process](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/oja9oh/why_are_there_no_spanish_layouts/).

## Special thanks to:
- **Miguel Guzmán.** I started researching this layout with him. He also gave me a lot of good tips and ideas, and he deserves some credit. 
- Colemak community: Specially DreymaR for his expert help, also to Renato and CTGAP.
- Subreddit r/KeyboardLayouts: Where I've find a lot of people who has the same rare taste that I have. A lot of people helped in the process.
- [HIEAMTSRN project](https://github.com/dns/Keyboard-HIEAMTSRN-Optimized): The new layout started as a variant of this one, but evolved into something very different. 
- [KLAnext analyzer](https://klanext.keyboard-design.com/): Which was the most useful tool I've come across to analyze keyboard layouts, even though I've used a few.
