# AEIOU
First keyboard layout 100% made for spanish language, made by the professional spanish typist **Nick GutiÃ©rrez**. I just discovered there wasn't a specialized layout in my language, and since I work all day long typing in spanish, it seemed logical to look for a solution myself on my free time. 

It also works with catalan, basque... and all kind of spanish dialects. 

There's two versions:

## AEIOU v1.0

The main version. You can make Ctrl+C only with right Ctrl, which can be a problem, but you will be more comfortable while typing.

## AEIOU zxcv v1.0

A version for people who wants to maintain all the usual shortcuts (ZXCV).

## Install
(Windows version in progress...)
[AEIOU Mac install.zip](https://github.com/NickG13/AEIOU/files/6834555/AEIOU.Mac.install.zip)
To install it on Mac, you only need to download the .zip file, unzip it and execute the .bundle . Then, you should be able to change the keyboard layout by going to Preferencias del sistema>Teclado>Fuentes de entrada, clicking "+" and selecting your layout under spanish language.

This layout has been made following all the requirements of a good layout, following both Engram and Colemak instructions and using several keyboard analyzers (not only one).
Here is a [description with all the process](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/oja9oh/why_are_there_no_spanish_layouts/).
