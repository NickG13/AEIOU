# AEIOU v1.3
First keyboard layout 100% made for spanish language, created by **Nick Gutiérrez** with help of veteran authors of popular keyboard layouts and the feedback of real users. It also work with catalan, basque... and all kind of spanish dialects. 

If you encounter any bug or mistake, be sure to leave feedback.

**Why did I made a fully optimized spanish layout?** 

*I just discovered there wasn't a single specialized layout in my language, and since I work all day long typing in spanish, it seemed logical to look for a solution myself on my free time. Since I'm only a writer and a psychologist obsessed with productivity, I've asked help and tips to experts and keyboard layout specialists and analysts, who made some of the best layouts in the world for the english language: Colemak, Engram... and finally, I'm here with a solution.*

The AEIOU name is based in the fact that all vowels are only on one side of the keyboard. It also resembles the easyness of typing with this keyboard layout once you practice for a few days. Indeed, I could achieve 20 wpm just in the first bunch of tests (without memorization of keys), which is faster than most other layout's beginning.

The AEIOU is made to be:
- **Faster typing**: Efficient and optimized for writing most frequent spanish words, with less finger traveling, avoiding same finger bigrams.
- **Ergonomical**: You will feel like you almost don't move your fingers from home row to write most words. 
- **For everyone**: It doesn't matter which kind of keyboard you have, even ANSI keyboards have their own version (spanish typers were limited to ISO only keyboards), so you can buy whatever strange mechanical keyboard you stumble upon without any hesitation. 

This is a keyboard layout inspired by the following layouts:
- Dvorak
- Colemak
- BÉPO
- Engram
- HIEAMTSRN

When you install it on Mac (the Windows 1.3 version should be valid for both), there's two versions, depending on which kind of keyboard you have: ISO or ANSI. 
- **ISO**: This is the usual layout on european countries keyboards. The extra key is **ü**, which is one of the less typed letters in spanish, and can be also made with alt+ú or by ¨+u
- **ANSI**: This is the usual layout for american countries keyboards, one key less.

This layout has been made following all the requirements of a good layout, following both Engram and Colemak keyboard layout building instructions, and using several keyboard analyzers (not only one) as well as the tips and review of expert builders.
