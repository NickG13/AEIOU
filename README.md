# AEIOU v1.3
First keyboard layout 100% made for spanish language, created by the professional spanish typist **Nick Gutiérrez**, with the help and tips of several experts and communities. It also work with catalan, basque... and all kind of spanish dialects. 

If you encounter any bug or mistake, be sure to leave feedback.

**Why did I made a fully optimized spanish layout?** 

*I just discovered there wasn't a single specialized layout in my language, and since I work all day long typing in spanish, it seemed logical to look for a solution myself on my free time. Since I'm only a writer and a psychologist obsessed with productivity, I've asked help and tips to experts and keyboard layout specialists and analysts, who made some of the best layouts in the world for the english language: Colemak, Engram... and finally, I'm here with a solution.*

The AEIOU name is based in the fact that all vowels are only on one side of the keyboard. It also resembles the easyness of typing with this keyboard layout once you practice for a few days. Indeed, I could achieve 20 wpm just in the first bunch of tests (without memorization of keys), which is faster than most other layout's beginning.

The AEIOU is made to be:
- **Faster typing**: Efficient and optimized for writing most frequent spanish words, with less finger traveling, avoiding same finger bigrams.
- **Ergonomical**: You will feel like you almost don't move your fingers from home row to write most words. 
- **For everyone**: It doesn't matter which kind of keyboard you have, even ANSI keyboards have their own version (spanish typers were limited to ISO only keyboards), so you can buy whatever strange mechanical keyboard you stumble upon without any hesitation. 


There's two versions, depending on which kind of keyboard you have: ISO or ANSI. 
- **ISO**: This is the usual layout on european countries keyboards
- **ANSI**: This is the usual layout for american countries keyboards


## AEIOU ISO

The main version. You can make Ctrl+C only with right Ctrl, which can be a problem, but you will be more comfortable while typing.

## AEIOU ANSI

A version for people who wants to maintain all the usual shortcuts (ZXCV). Be advised you will write slower and with less comfort.
